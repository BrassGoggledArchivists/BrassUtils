### Info About This Mod
I intended for this mod to be very similar to the original Geartooth suggestion, however, I also wanted to add more substance to apease the Modjam judges. Below are a few ideas I have for this mod:

1. The Gloves themselves are not really special except that they place destroyed items into your Ender Chest inventory.
  * The Gloves have a farily lowish durability and mining speed. The glove may also allow you to access your Ender Chest by right-clicking with the glove, although that may be to OP. This action may consume durability. Alternativly, the glove could place an ender chest on right click, if you have one in your inventory.
  * The Gloves can only be found in an Ender Totem Pole chest. More info on those below. There may be a config option for a crafting recipe. 
  * The glove will make broken blocks emit portal particles, and the "Ender Eye Explosion" when the block breaks.
  * (?)The gloves will not take durability damage when used in their home dimension.
  * There will most likely be a way to repair the gloves. Ideas: 
     * Returning the gloves to the totem will slowly repair them
     * Expensive repair recipie, involving eyes of ender, endstone and such.
     * Repair 'ritual'
2. You can (probably should!) add Enchantments to your Ender Gloves to beef up their abilities. Some are Vanilla, others are new. Max level for enchants is the same as vanilla, or IV for new ones.
   * Silk Touch: yup, one of our favorite Enchantments. This one is compatible with the Gloves. Clashes with Fortune + Fire Aspect.
   * Fortune: Also compatible with Gloves. Clashes with Silk Touch + Fire Aspect.
   * Efficiency: since the Gloves are pretty slow at first, this one's nice.
   * Fire Aspect: At the cost of double durability/block (?), the glove becomes autosmelting. Clashes with Silk Touch and Fortune.
   * Sharpness(?): Each level adds 2 points of damage onto the glove.
   * Extending: Increases the reach of the glove by one block per level.
   * Affluent: more experience per block, each level increases the bonus.
   * Artisan: if you click on a crafting grid with the Gloves equipped, any crafted item might (prboably about a 15% chance) yield a bonus item. Obviously, this Enchantment is very rare. Very, very rare.
   * Spelunker: shift right-clicking with this Enchantment spawns an Eye of the Ender to find the closest valuable ore.
      * You *must* have an Eye of the Ender in your inventory for this to work. 
      * Details about how this will work are still being thought out. xD
      * Each level of this Enchantment determines what type of ore it can find.
   *Teleport: yup, this Enchantment works just like an Enderpearl. 
      * There is a cooldown timer that is affected by the level of Enchantment on the Gloves.
      * No fall damage will be taken from the teleport
   * 'Enderhand' Enchantment: an Enchantment to teleport hit mobs to a set location.
      * Don't know how this one's gonna work out. :P
   * 'Yoink' Enchant: Right click on an item to suck it into your ender chest.
3. Ender Totem: an ancient statue left behind by older, more sophisticated Enderman.
  * Strange particles encircle this statue.
  * Atop the totem pole is a chest with goodies. May be a custom 'Endstone Chest' or even a 'Totem Eye' or some such. Could act like a display stand rather than a chest.
  * This is the only place where you can find the Ender Gloves.
  * When you retrive the gloves, the Ender Dragon death animation plays.
