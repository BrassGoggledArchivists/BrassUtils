### Info About This Mod
I intended for this mod to be very similar to the original Geartooth suggestion, however, I also wanted to add more substance to apease the Modjam judges. Below are a few ideas I have for this mod:

1. The Gloves themselves are not really special except that they place destroyed items into your Ender Chest inventory.
  * The Gloves have a farily lowish durability and mining speed.
  * The Gloves can only be found in an Ender Totem Pole chest. More info on those below.
2. You can add Enchantments to your Ender Gloves to beef up their abilities. Some are Vanilla, others are new.
3. Silk Touch: yup, one of our favorite Enchantments. This one is compatible with the Gloves.
4. Efficiency: since the Gloves are pretty slow at first, this one's nice.
5. Affluent: more experience per block, each level increases the bonus.
6. Artisan: if you click on a crafting grid with the Gloves equipped, any crafted item might yield a bonus item.
  * Obviously, this Enchantment is very rare. Very, very rare.
7. Spelunker: shift right-clicking with this Enchantment spawns an Eye of the Ender to find the closest valuable ore.
  * You *must* have an Eye of the Ender in your inventory for this to work. 
  * Details about how this will work are still being thought out. xD
  * Each level of this Enchantment determines what type of ore it can find.
8. Teleport: yup, this Enchantment works just like an Enderpearl. 
  * There is a cooldown timer that is affected by the level Enchantment on the Gloves.
9. Creative Enchantment: an Enchantment to teleport hit mobs to a set location.
  * Don't know how this one's gonna work out. :P
10. Ender Totem: an ancient statue left behind by older, more sophisticated Enderman.
  * Strange particles encircle this statue.
  * Atop the totem pole is a chest with goodies.
  * This is the only place where you can find the Ender Gloves.

### Note to Team Members
warlordjones: if you're working on the model, you can being on that; you can also begin adding enchantments. <br/>
Snurly: you already know what you're doing. ;) <br/>
Rongmario: you can help warlordjones with the Enchantments. Possibly totem work + generation. <br/>
Surseance: creating the ender item and determining how to make it fancy.
