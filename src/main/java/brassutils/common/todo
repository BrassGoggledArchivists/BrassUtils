/** 
	 * Ideas: 
	 * - Throwable Rocks 
	 * - Splitter TNT 
	 * - Flamethrower
	 * - Slime Block from 1.8
	 * - Jump Pad: Increases Jump height, slime block + piston 
	 * - Sticky Slime Block: Slime Block + water. No Jumping. 
	 * - Pile of Bones block: Gravity, acts like old bonemeal+ other buff somehow? 4x4 or 9x9 Bones? 
	 * - Compressed Bone Block: Like Pile of bones, but with no gravity. 4x4 pile o bones. 
	 * - Gunpowder + String = Fuses. Place like redstone, light one end, and fire will quickly travel down it 
	 * - Enchanting water bottle = Bottle of Enchanting? 
	 * - Bundle of Sugar Cane: Looks like bamboo 
	 * - Smelt Glowstone into Smooth glowstone? 
	 * - Polished Endstone and Obsidian. 4x4. 
	 * - Bedroll from Hay Bales/Feather Block. Durability, somehow? Won't set spawn. 
	 * - Splash Water bottle for fire extinguishing.
	 * - Desert Golem that throws sand, giving you blindness? 
	 * - Smoothstone Stairs!! 
	 * - Liquid Concrete: hardens into concrete 
	 * - Rebar: Makes solid concrete harder 
	 * - Ping sound when your name is said in chat? 
	 * - Stone Pillars! 
	 * - Brick + Netherbrick in 4x4 is special brick texture http://imgur.com/a/PVvHP#4 
	 * - Low Gravity Field: Higher Jump in a radius (5x5x5?) around block 
	 * - Weighted Boots: Causes player to fall very fast, but allows them to sink quickly in water? If you fall on something it damages it - damages entities, breaks glass, cracks bricks. 
	 * - Some way to turn off rain.
	 * - Spear: Throw with right, stab with left -
	 * - Slime in a Bucket :D 
	 * - Antigrav field
